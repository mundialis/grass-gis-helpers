# Release and version

Steps when releasing:

- Run in terminal
  ```
  ESTIMATED_VERSION=1.0.0
  REPO_NAME=mundialis/grass-gis-helpers

  gh api repos/$REPO_NAME/releases/generate-notes -f tag_name="$ESTIMATED_VERSION" -f target_commitish=main -q .body
  ```
- Go to [new release](../../releases/new)
- Copy the output of terminal command to the release description
- You can [compare manually](../../compare/1.0.0...main) if all changes are included. If changes were pushed directly to main branch, they are not included.
- Check if `ESTIMATED_VERSION` increase still fits - we follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
- Fill in tag and release title with this version
- At the bottom of the release, add
  "generated with `gh api repos/$REPO_NAME/releases/generate-notes -f tag_name="$ESTIMATED_VERSION" -f target_commitish=main -q .body`" and replace `$REPO_NAME` and `$ESTIMATED_VERSION` with the actual version.
- Make sure that the checkbox for "Set as the latest release" is checked so that this version appears on the main github repo page
- Now you can save the release
